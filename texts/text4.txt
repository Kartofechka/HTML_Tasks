A loser hides behind a mask of my disguise,
And who I am today is worse than other times.
You don't know what I've done,
I'm wanted and on the run,
I'm wanted and on the run.
So I'm taking this moment to live in the future.

Release me from the present,
I'm obsessing all these questions,
Why I'm in denial
That they tried the suicidal session,
Please, use discretion
When you're messing with the message, man,
These lyrics aren't for everyone,
Only few understand.

You don't know my brain the way
You know my name,
You don't know my heart the way
You know my face.
You don't know what I've done,
I'm wanted and on the run,
I'm wanted and on the run,
So I'm taking this moment to live in the future.

Release me from the present,
I'm obsessing all these questions,
Why I'm in denial
That they tried the suicidal session,
Please, use discretion
When you're messing with the message, man,
These lyrics aren't for everyone,
Only few understand.

My people singing,
My people singing.

I hope you're dead,
'Cause how could you sleep at a time like this,
People, they rhyme like this,
We're all impressed by this,
They rip it, flip it,
But these are just triplets,
Wrote this in three minutes,
Three words to a line,
It's just poetry divided,
I'm the kind of guy, who takes every moment.
He knows he can fight in,
Music to use
It for others to use it,
You're dead,
'Cause how could you sleep at a time like this.
Life is up here,
But you comment below,
And the comments will always become common motivation
To promote your show's next episode,
So your brain knows to keep going,
Even though hope is far from this moment,
But you and I know it
Gets better
When morning finally rears its head,
Together we're losers,
Remember the future,
Remember the morning is when night is dead.

Release me from the present,
I'm obsessing all these questions,
Why I'm in denial
That they tried the suicidal session,
Please, use discretion
When you're messing with the message, man,
These lyrics aren't for everyone,
Only few understand.

Please, use discretion
When you're messing with the message, man,
These lyrics aren't for everyone,
Only few understand.

My people singing,
My people singing,
My people singing.
